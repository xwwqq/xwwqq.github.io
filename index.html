Hello, teacher, 
this is my homework for this week. I forgot to do my homework last week, so I started to do it this week.
This is my home page, and I uploaded my project to github.But I may not be able to see the page,
because some file contents may be deleted by accident.
 I am trying to make up for it. 
Next week, I will upload my project and webpage to the server you mentioned 
(because I haven't asked the study committee about the specific uploading method).

Hope next week goes well!
Have a nice day
