<p>Hello, teacher</p> 
<p>this is my homework for this week. I forgot to do my homework last week, so I started to do it this week.</p>
<p>This is my home page, and I uploaded my project to github.But I may not be able to see the page,</p>
because some file contents may be deleted by accident.</p>
<p> I am trying to make up for it. </p>
<p>Next week, I will upload my project and webpage to the server you mentioned 
(because I haven't asked the study committee about the specific uploading method).</p>

<p>Hope next week goes well!</p>
<p>Have a nice day !!</p>
